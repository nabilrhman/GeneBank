Concept:
The Concept of this Project was to apply a BTree to a real world application which in our case was a Gene file 
that would input specific characters into structures to form protein combinations. The goal was to take the sequence
of characters and convert them to a key which would then be stored into a ROM that could be called upon later. And
for a user to search through the BTree to find any combinations of keys that could match a protein sequence that
the user inputted.
Usage:
For GeneBankCreate <Usecache> <degree> <gbk file> <sequence length> [<cache size>] [<debuglevel>]
For GeneBankSearch <0/1(no/with Cache)> <btree file> <query file> [<cache size>] [<debug level>]
Debugging: 
The debugging process prominently occured during the testing of the GeneBankSearch, there were issues
with the initialization of Variables within the class. I.E BTree tree would not initialzie due to the file not
even though it existed.
Journal:
We kept track of our conversations via Slack

@Austin Foy Hi Austin. How are you doing? I was wondering if you have an account in GitHub. If you don't have one, 
create one and let me know your GitHub username and e-mail. I will add you to the repo. (edited)

Austin Foy [8:57 PM]
I do have a GitHub my Username is AFoy95
at austinfoy@u.boisestate.edu

Nabil [1:17 AM]
Added. Please check if you can access it.

Austin Foy [6:56 PM]
I do have access thank you

@Austin Foy Hey Austin, I am sorry that we had some communication gap. I actually wrote the parser a couple of days 
back but I forgot to upload them on GitHub. I saw that you wrote it too. Either way, they pretty much look the same. 
Would you mind taking a look at the origin master on our GitHub repo? I have done GeneBankCreateTree too. Thanks.
Austin Foy [9:54 PM]
@Maruf Hey Maruf I actually tested your code alongside Nabil's BTree code.The code for the GeneBankCreate.java whenever 
I  would run the inorder print method from Nabil's BTree class would receive a blank output

Austin Foy [10:00 PM]
I am going to modify the code on my own computer assure proper results

Nabil [2:11 AM]
@Austin Foy Hey Austin, that sounds awesome! I was a bit confused when I saw similar codes from you two. I wasn't sure whose 
code I was supposed to use. I used Maruf's at first. But, don't worry. We can also try using yours too. I am sorry that we didn't 
communicate with you before we started writing the codes. Feel free to let me know if you need any help. I am going to work on the 
rest tomorrow and try figuring out what the problem is.

Austin Foy [9:55 AM]
Good news I have tested the BTree search and have found that the reason for a failure that has to do with the way it was inputted 
from the command line,initially it would never create the btree because the input of in the command line would be a large string 
and there would be no parsing of the sequence length and degree. Then it would fail to find the file to read from, so i added a 
parser that looked for the gbk mark to read data. And now it works for the most part

Austin Foy [1:07 PM]
Hey guys are we ready to submit or have we already submitted

Nabil [1:11 PM]
Has anyone written the README? If not, I can work on that and get it ready for the submission. When do you guys want to submit? 
Do you know when the deadline is? 'Cause on the instruction, it says that it's at the end of the semester which should be 
by this Friday.

Austin Foy [3:24 PM]
I have written part of the readme for my portion but not the total product, I think we submit once we get the BTreeSearch to work 
a little better, if we cant do that we submit friday before mdnight

Nabil [1:28 PM]
Hey Austin, I have just merged your pull requests. For some reason, the program is not working. Can you send me the working codes 
you have on your computer? Just make a zip file of the whole project, and give me a link to download.
Final Thoughts:
Austin Foy:
  I felt that this project was a good lesson in general about the need to communicate effectively it was hard for us to do so even
  with a Slack and emails. But having said that I thought this project was fun and challenging
